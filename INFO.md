Get rich notifications in chat for activity in your GitHub repositories and
harness the power of ChatOps.

-   See all commit, push, issue and pull request activity in neatly presented
    chat messages
-   Notifications are actionable—react to GitHub activity from Slack or MS
    Teams—comment on issues and PRs, close issues and merge PRs with buttons
    right in the Slack message
-   The same messages and actions are available on your phone with the Slack and
    MS Teams mobile apps
-   Easily configure the amount of information you get in notification messages

Enabling this skill turns on notifications and provides commands for GitHub
actions from Slack or Microsoft Teams.
